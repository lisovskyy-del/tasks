    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <center>
      <span style="background-color: red">ax + b = 0</span>
    </center>
    <p>
      where <span style="color: red">a</span> and
      <span style="color: red">b</span> are real numbers and x is a variable.
      This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note
      that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the
      variable may or may not be an <span style="color: red">x</span> so don't
      get too locked into always seeing an
      <span style="color: red">x</span> there.
    </p>
    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <center>
      <span style="background-color: red">ax2 + bx + c = 0</span>
    </center>
    <p>
      where <span style="color: red">a, b, c</span> are known values and
      <span style="color: red">x</span> is the variable or unknown(we don't know
      it yet). Also, <span style="color: red">a</span> can't be 0.
    </p>
    <h3>The area of a circle(A)</h3>
    <p>π times the radius <span style="color: red">(r)</span> squared</p>
    <center>
      <span style="background-color: red">A = π x r2</span>
    </center>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter(<span style="color: red">D</span>):</p>
    <center>
      <span style="background-color: red">A = (π / 4) x D2</span>
    </center>
    <p>
      or, when you know the circumference(<span style="color: red">C</span>):
    </p>
    <center>
      <span style="background-color: red">A = C2 / 4 x π</span>
    </center>
    <h3>Intersection</h3>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets <span style="color: red">A</span> and
      <span style="color: red">B</span>, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all
      objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>
    <center>
      <span style="background-color: red">A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}</span>
    </center>
    <p>
      That is, <span style="color: red">x</span> is an element of the
      intersection A ∩ B if and only if <span style="color: red">x</span> is
      both an element of <span style="color: red">A</span> and an element of
      <span style="color: red">B</span>.
